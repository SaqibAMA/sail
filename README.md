# SAIL â€” A community-driven wholesale platform.
SAIL is a community-driven wholesale platform that allows users to buy any product at cheaper rate than market by collaboratively placing orders.

Once a product has enough orders placed, our team buys the product in bulk from manufacturers at discounted rates and ships them directly to consumers. We eliminate the middle-man and only bring those products to the platform which are requested by our community.
